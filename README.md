# WeatherAPI
Simple Weather app using current location, actual temp and real feel

The initial build and idea was taken from 'devEd' tutorial.
However i found that the API and icons he used were no longer available.
After some research i opted for weather API, i decided to grow the display and an add real temp to the app.

In using weatherAPI i had to implement without aid of a tutorial and also in doing manged to remove the need to import icons as this API provides them.
